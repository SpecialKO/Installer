To install Special K (assuming you did not already use the main installer):
=====================

 Begin by creating a Special K directory in the desired install location.

 >> This new directory is Grand Central Station for Special K! <<

   @ You are encouraged to take a minute or two to review
     Special K's directory structure prior to installation...

     ..or skip past the below "Overview" section to continue!


Overview of Data Stored in "Documents\My Mods\SpecialK":
--------------------------------------------------------

 * Per-game Configuration Settings

   + Most Games:        ( Profiles\<Localized Application Name>\*.ini )
   + Exceptions:        ( Profiles\<NameOfGame.exe>\*.ini             )

 * Shared preferences

   + Steam Enhancements ( Global\steam.ini  )
   + Keyboard Macros    ( Global\macros.ini )

   + Injection Control

     # White/Blacklist  ( Global\{white|black}list.ini )
      \
       ) Injection white/blacklists are a line-delimited list of Reg.Exp. patterns
       ) that match executable filenames or partial paths, see SKIF for more details.

 * Plug-Ins
   --------
  + Official    (PlugIns\ThirdParty)  [ Unmodified Off-the-Shelf Products]
  + Unofficial  (PlugIns\Unofficial)  [ Have Exclusive Special K Features]

 * Drivers

   > Isolated copies of system DLLs that are not normally thread-safe (i.e. dbghelper.dll)
     are stored here so that games and Special K can both safely use the thread unsafe DLL.
   > WinRing0 may also be unpacked if you turn on advanced CPU hardware monitoring.

 * Version

   + Information about the currently installed version, as well as backup copies of old
     versions are stored here for any version control enabled mod / component of Special K.

Installation
============
  > If you have a license for the Steam version, skip past this section. <


 Extract the contents of this archive to your desired Special K install folder,
   replacing any DLLs left-over from a previous installation.


 A bare minimum install will include the following files:

  * SKIF.exe  (Special K Injection Frontend + Quickest Library/Game Launcher Around!)
    ========
   * SpecialK32.dll  (32-bit version of Special K)
   * SpecialK64.dll  (64-bit version of Special K)

   * A directory called "Servlet" with service hosts that handles the injection service.


 Additional files you may see:

  * SpecialK{32|64}.pdb  (Debug Symbols to improve the level of detail in crash logs)

    +  You may delete the Debug Symbols to save disk space, the software will
       work the same with or without.

  * PlugIns\ThirdParty\Steamworks holds redistributable Steam API files
      used for compatibility purposes with Steam games.

  * Various 0-1 KB dummy files (used as placeholders for users' convenience)

  * Empty folders (also used as placeholders for users' convenience)


 Create a shortcut to SKIF.exe and you are done installing Special K :)

XXX Installation for Steam Licensed Special K Testers
XXX =================================================

 + Special K is no longer distributed through Steam, however, your beta license allows you
     to install and run SK from ( SteamApps\common\SpecialK\ ) and doing so will accumulate
       played hours in the Steam version.

  # No better way to show your support for Special K than to be one of the few thousand users
      with a Steam license racking up playing time in an ultra rare application your friends
        can never play. You will be the envy of everyone :)

  > On a serious note, you have the option of installing to that directory or to the normal
      Special K install folder, but you should take care not to wind up with Special K
        installed in both locations.  ( Pick one, and only one place for SK!! )


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Uninstall Special K
======================

 Oh noes!

   Sorry to see you go; if a technical issue prompted this, did you first swing by the
     Special K Discord server or forums (https://special-k.info) and try to get
       assistance with your problem?

     We are happy to help if we can.

 ---
 Whatever your reason, uninstalling Special K is as simple as:

  1. Stop the injection service in SKIF
  2. Delete Servlet subdirectory from Install Path
  3. Delete SKIF.exe and SpecialK{32|64}.{pdb|dll}

  Many additional files will linger after doing this, they are harmless and isolated to the
  subdirectories where SKIF.exe was located.

    If you really want to do a full uninstall, which will wipe any Steam HDR screenshots, and
    customized game configuration, you may nuke the entire Special K directory.

      >> Note that if the injection service was active prior to performing the steps listed
         above, some or all of the directory structure may be locked by a program that still
         has Special K's DLL loaded.

         Logging out and back in should release all directory locks and allow you to finish a
         complete wipe of Special K.

  Registry Keys:   We've got em; sounds like you don't want em...
  *************    ----------------------------------------------

   Special K stores a few registry keys in the HKCU System Registry Hive:

     "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Kaldaien\Special K\..."

   Delete those too if you are truly determined to eradicate all traces of Special K; yeesh! :)



  At this point Special K is completely gone.

    Pirates may try to convince you there are magic files leftover that nobody but them know
      anything about, doing all manner of ridiculous things. At this point, that is a running
        joke. You should not take seriously stories told by crazy homeless people panhandling
          for booze money; this is the digital equivalent, sad but you have to ignore it.
